			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<div class="aboutMeSection">
				I’ve worn a lot of different hats in my young career, all important to getting me to where I am today.
				<div class="picParagraph">
					<p>I started out as getting my degree in Chemical Engineering, along the way working a year long co-op at a large chemical plant. Although I enjoyed the unique design challenges the chemical engineering field presents, what really excited me was working was process modeling in MATLAB and system controller design.</p>
					<img class="aboutMePic" src="./img/chemical-plant.jpg" alt="Chemical plant"/>
				</div>
				With those preferences in mind, I pursued work in IT upon graduation and took a job as an onsite consultant implementing new billing software for a local hospital. I’ve always had faith in my technical ability, but this job allowed me to sharpen my skills in a number of different areas including leadership, project management, building client relationships, and coordinating between multiple different stakeholder groups. It also provided me the opportunity to work extensively with SQL databases, in that I was often tasked with writing complex queries to generate reports that were used everyday by hospital medical and administrative staff. 
				<div class="picParagraph">
					<img class="aboutMePic" src="./img/Venus.png" alt="Picture of Venus">
					<p>Working with SQL reignited my passion for computer coding and I began teaching myself the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript on the side. I found the work incredibly rewarding, and knowing that I had finally found what I was meant to do, decided to leave my job to pursue a career in Software Engineering.</p>
				</div>
				If I’m not codding you can probably find my rooting for (or agonizing over) Washington sports teams or walking my dog and best friend Venus.
